# Employee_Management_System
I developed this employee management system using PYTHON, TKINTER and SQL working on Visual Studio Code and MySQL.
You need to setup database and enter details of database in the code so that you can connect database server to your python code.
Also need to change size of window to the size of window on which you are working ( Default:1980 x 1280 ).
